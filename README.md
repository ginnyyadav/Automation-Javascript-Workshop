# Automation-Javascript-Workshop

After some reflection about how people best learn, I've decided to hold some javascript automation workshops. These workshops are designed to teach vanillla javascript to use in our automation platforms (mainly postman and ghost inspector to start with). We will be covering a javascript topic each week and then implementing it in either postman or ghost inspector or both. This will be an active meeting, where you will code along with me. We will solve problems together, get stuck together and create tests together. This will not be rushed. If we don't finish a topic, we will continue that topic into the next week.
We will be using VSCode as our editor.

This repo will continue helper files for the week in question. Each branch will be a different week of workshop and will contain a readme with notes from the meeitng as well as any files pertinent to that week's workshop.
